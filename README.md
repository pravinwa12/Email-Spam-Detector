We have developed a sophisticated email spam detector aimed at enhancing email security and user experience. The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques 
to accurately identify and filter out spam emails. Key features of our email spam detector include:

Data Collection:
A comprehensive dataset of both spam and legitimate emails was compiled to ensure the model's effectiveness.

Data Preprocessing:
Emails were cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, standardizing the text for better analysis.

Feature Extraction:
Important features were extracted from the email content and metadata, including word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, and email structure.

Model Training: 
Various machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests, were trained and optimized to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.

Model Evaluation:
The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure their reliability and effectiveness in identifying spam.

Deployment: 
The final model was deployed using Flask for the web application interface and Docker for containerization, allowing for seamless integration with existing email systems and scalability.
